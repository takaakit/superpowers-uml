# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Verify UML model alignment → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Iron Law

```
NO UML MODEL ELEMENTS OR DIAGRAMS THAT DO NOT MATCH THE CODE
```

If the UML model element or diagram is inconsistent with the code, it must be brought into alignment with the code.

## Step 1: Verify Tests

Run the project's full test suite (`npm test` / `cargo test` / `pytest` / `go test ./...`).

**If tests fail**, report the failures and stop — the menu comes after a green suite:

```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]
```

**If tests pass:** continue to Step 2.

## Step 2: Verify UML Model Alignment

**Use Astah Pro MCP tools to verify that the implementation is consistent with the model and diagrams:**

- Compare the model and diagrams with the actual source files.
- Check that model elements (classes, interfaces, enumerations, attributes, operations, relationships, and dependencies) are consistent with the structural definitions in the code.
- Check that use case diagrams reflect functionality actually provided by the code.
- Check that class diagrams reflect the class structure and relationships in the code.
- Check that sequence diagrams reflect the method call order in the code.
- Check that activity diagrams reflect the code logic.
- Check that state machine diagrams reflect the state transitions in the code.
- Check that note contents in diagrams are consistent with the code.
- Check that UML diagrams conform to the diagram layout guide.

**If mismatches found:**

```
UML model alignment issues found:
- [list each mismatch with file:code line and model-element/diagram reference]

Cannot proceed until resolved. Update model, then re-run verification.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 3.

**If aligned:** continue to Step 3.

## Step 3: Detect Environment

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
# Capture now, while still inside the workspace — Step 6 changes directory
# before cleanup (Step 7) needs this value
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 3 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 3 options | Provenance-based (see Step 7) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 2 options (no merge) | Externally managed — leave in place |

## Step 4: Determine Base Branch

The base branch is whatever this work forked from — usually named in the
plan, the conversation, or the branch's upstream. If it is not already
known, ask: "This branch split from <your best guess> - is that correct?"
Confirm before merging: merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo.

## Step 5: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 2 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)

Which option?
```

Present the menu exactly as written — concise, with every option coming
from the list above. Discarding the work happens only in response to your
human partner explicitly asking for it (see "If your human partner asks to
discard the work" below). Wait for their answer; the integration decision
is theirs.

## Step 6: Execute Choice

### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Get main repo root for CWD safety
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

# Merge first — verify success before removing anything
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>
```

If tests fail on the merged result: stop, leave the worktree and branch in
place, and investigate — nothing has been pushed, so the merge is local
and recoverable.

Once the merged result is green: clean up the worktree (Step 7), then
delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
# From a detached HEAD, name the new branch on the remote:
# git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/<new-branch>
```

Then create the pull/merge request against <base-branch> with the forge's
tooling — its CLI if one is available, or the creation URL most forges
print when you push — following the repo's PR template and conventions if
present, and report the URL to your human partner.

Keep the worktree — your human partner iterates on PR feedback there.

### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

### If your human partner asks to discard the work

This path exists only as a response to an explicit request to throw the
work away. Confirm first:

```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for that exact confirmation. When it arrives:

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then clean up the worktree (Step 7) and force-delete the branch:

```bash
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

## Step 7: Cleanup Workspace

**Runs for Option 1 and confirmed discards.** Options 2 and 3 always
preserve the worktree. Both callers have already changed directory to the
main repo root — worktree removal must run from outside the worktree —
and use the `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_COMMON`/`WORKTREE_PATH` values captured in
Step 3, from before that directory change.

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If `WORKTREE_PATH` is under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`:** Superpowers
created this worktree — we own cleanup:

```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**Otherwise:** The host environment owns this workspace — leave it in
place. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| Discard (explicit request only) | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "The model is close enough to the code" | The Iron Law is exact alignment. Bring one into line with the other — "close enough" is how a model rots into fiction. |
| "I'll sync the UML model after the merge" | Nobody comes back. A model that ships out of sync stays out of sync. |
| "Tests passed earlier this session" | Run the suite on the tree you are about to integrate. A green run only proves the tree it ran on. |
| "They obviously want it merged" | Integration is your human partner's decision. Present the menu and wait. |
| "They seem done with this feature — I'll offer to discard it" | The menu is complete as written. Discard happens only when your human partner asks for it in so many words. |
| "'Yeah, get rid of it' counts as confirmation" | Only the typed word `discard` authorizes deletion. |
| "The PR is up, so the worktree is clutter now" | PR feedback gets fixed in that worktree. It stays until the work lands. |
| "This other worktree looks stale — I'll clean it too" | Clean up only worktrees under `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`. Everything else belongs to the host. |
| "The merged-result failure is probably flaky" | A failing merged result stops everything. Branch and worktree stay put while you investigate. |
| "The base branch is obviously main" | Confirm the fork point or ask. Merging into the wrong base is expensive to undo. |
| "The push was rejected — force-push will fix it" | A rejected push means the remote moved. Investigate; force-push only on your human partner's explicit request. |
